\chapter{Introduction}

Unbiased information about animal population ecology gives biologists vital
information about the effects of different physical or biological factors on
the distribution and abandance of animal species, which plays a key role in the
development of effective conservation strategies for rare and endangered
species. Typical approaches biologists take to estimate the precise size of a
population of species often involves physically marking the animals. These
approaches are not only expensive in terms of time and cost, but they are also
unhealthy for the animals.

As an alternative, ability to identify an individual animal by recognizing its
photographs allows researchers to monitor the species' diversity, and dispersal
in a non-invasive. Researchers can track the movements and observe the genetic
variation of a species by comparing each member's images with the all the
existing images collected from different time and locations. However, the
arduous task of comparing over a thousand images of every individual animal and
their potential matches makes manual reviews impracticable for large
collections. To alliviate the problem, we need to automate the recognition
process using computer-based image recognition techniques.

The considerable progress we have seen in computer vision is largely due to
local descriptor-based algorithms, such as SIFT\cite{lowe04}, and
SURF\cite{surf08}, etc. The field of computer vision covers a wide range of
topics. For the purpose of animal image biometric, this thesis will deal mostly
with the image classification and recognition problems. Despite the stellar
performance of these algorithms in the past decades, there exists a substancial
gap between human-level performance and theirs. In this work, we present two
improvements, whose results have shown to bridge the performance gap between
human and these machine-based algorithms, to \emph{Sloop}, the first pattern
retrieval engine for animal biometric incorperating crowd-sourced relevance
feedback.

In the last few years, deep convolutional neural networks\cite{lecun95, kriz12}
have outperformed SIFTs and other descriptor-based techniques by a large margin
in both object recognition and classification tasks\cite{kriz12, fisher14,
ILSVRC15}. In fact, the architecture has demonstrated recognition accuracy
comparable to humans in several visual recognition tasks, such as recognizing
faces\cite{deepface14}, and handwritten digits\cite{mnist13}. Motivated by the
preceding achievements, we integrate a pre-trained convolutional neural network
into a new python version of Sloop, \emph{SlooPy}, as a seperate image
processing workflow.

Despite the scalability, and advantages of computational speed in automatic
pattern recognition, some classification errors could occur and rapidly
propagate. Some degree of human involvement may benefit the identification
process. Not only can user input resolve the errors, but it can also be used to
train machine learning model. The model can incrementally learn from the
accumulation of user input data in our retrieval system, which create a
positive feedback loop where the model learns its mistakes from the previous
iterations and re-evaluate its strategy based on the gold standard responses
from human given at the previous iteration. However, this is out of the scope
of our work. In this project, we focus on the problem of how we can maximize
the the information gain from a given amount of user input.

This project involves design and implementation of two additional features of
Sloop, an existing pattern retrieval engine for individual animal
identification. The features include: \begin{enumerate} \item Relevance
Feedback Integration \item Convolutional Neural Network Integration
\end{enumerate}

\section{Problem Statements}

\subsection{Relevance Feedback} % (fold) \label{sub:relevance_feedback} One
problem of interest is assigning tasks to workers with the goal of maximizing
the quality of completed tasks at a low prices or subject to budget
constraints.

\subsection{Image Recognition} % (fold) \label{sub:image_recognition} The
emergence of convolutional neural network pushes forward the frontiers of all
domains of computer vision \cite{lecun95}. Recent studies shows that
convolutional neural network architecture clearly dominates the handcrafted
features, and traditional orientation-based local descriptors, such as
SIFT\cite{lowe04}, and SURF\cite{surf08}, etc. in classification
tasks\cite{fisher14,kriz12,prelu15,ILSVRC15}.

The second part of the thesis presents a new architecture whose goal is to
improve the identification accuracy as well as curtail or eliminate human
involvement. We compare the recognition ability of the two algorithms: SIFT and
convolutional neural network.

\section{Challenges}

The animal identification task involves two major challenges: \emph{image
feature extraction problem}, and \emph{pattern recognition problem}. 

Image feature extraction problem involves locating the animal in the image, and
extract the features required for the matching. The choice of feature selection
varies from species to species. The extracted feature object of an image is then
passed into the pattern recognition algorithm to find the matches existed in the
system. Current Sloop locates the animal and necessary features of an image by
having the user click on the key points of the animal, and then calculates the
feature vector using SIFT. It performs the matching by scoring the similarity of
the SIFT object. 

Traditional approaches in machine learning generally require training samples to
be available for all the categories. Moreover, such approaches are designed to
handle only the dataset with finite or limited, preferably small, number of
categories. Nevertheless, our application requires ability to recognize high
dimensional input, whose categories are not known in advance. In addition, while
the number of categories can be very large, the number of examples per category
can be very small.
