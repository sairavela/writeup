\chapter{Introduction}



Unbiased information about animal population ecology gives biologists vital information about the effects of different physical or biological factors on the distribution and abandance of animal species, which plays a key role in the development of effective conservation strategies for rare and endangered species. Typical approaches biologists take to estimate the precise size of a population of species often involves physically marking the animals. These approaches are not only expensive in terms of time and cost, but they are also unhealthy for the animals.

As an alternative, ability to identify an individual animal by recognizing its photographs allows researchers to monitor the species' diversity, and dispersal in a non-invasive. Researchers can track the movements and observe the genetic variation of a species by comparing each member's images with the all the existing images collected from different time and locations. However, the arduous task of comparing over a thousand images of every individual animal and their potential matches makes manual reviews impracticable for large collections. To alliviate the problem, we need to automate the recognition process using computer-based image recognition techniques.

The considerable progress we have seen in image recognition in the past decades is largely due to local descriptor-based algorithms, such as SIFT\cite{lowe04}, and SUFT\cite{surf08}, etc. The record 

The performance of recognition techniques thrives over the last few years due to convolutional neural network

them: image retrieval is based on aggregated SIFT descriptors, structure from motion started to work reliably due to SIFT correspondences, and even in low level problems, such as optical flow estimation, orientation histograms help deal with large motion [2].

Our major goal is to achieve 

This project involves design and implementation of two additional features of Sloop, an existing pattern retrieval engine for individual animal identification. The features include:
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Relevance Feedback Integration
	\item Convolutional Neural Network Integration
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Image Recognition} % (fold)
\label{sub:image_recognition}
The emergence of convolutional neural network pushes forward the frontiers of all domains of computer vision \cite{lecun95}. Recent studies shows that convolutional neural network architecture clearly dominates the handcrafted features, and traditional orientation-based local descriptors, such as SIFT\cite{lowe04}, and SURF\cite{surf08}, etc. in classification tasks\cite{fisher14, kriz12}.

The second part of the thesis presents a new architecture whose goal is to improve the identification accuracy as well as curtail or eliminate human involvement. We compare the recognition ability of the two algorithms: SIFT and convolutional neural network.

\section{Challenges}

The animal identification task involves two major challenges: \emph{image feature extraction problem}, and \emph{pattern recognition problem}. 

Image feature extraction problem involves locating the animal in the image, and extract the features required for the matching. The choice of feature selection varies from species to species. The extracted feature object of an image is then passed into the pattern recognition algorithm to find the matches existed in the system. Current Sloop locates the animal and necessary features of an image by having the user click on the key points of the animal, and then calculates the feature vector using SIFT. It performs the matching by scoring the similarity of the SIFT object. 

Traditional approaches in machine learning generally require training samples to be available for all the categories. Moreover, such approaches are designed to handle only the dataset with finite or limited, preferably small, number of categories. Nevertheless, our application requires ability to recognize high dimensional input, whose categories are not known in advance. In addition, while the number of categories can be very large, the number of examples per category can be very small.
