\section{Convolutional Neural Network}

One possible improvement is to tailor and train the parameters of the Convolutional Network to best fit our data. However, this requires a much larger dataset of labeled images. Therefore, we need to increase the size of our dataset.

In order to properly evaluate the new system performance, we should use the SIFT algorithm in the previous system as our baseline. We have already generated the SIFT object representing each images available in the system however, they are generated from a sets of keypoints that are manually marked so that it is able to acheives 99.99\% ranking accuracy. With such biase, it is hard to evaluate the relative performance between the new and the old system.

Further, we can evaluate the performance of the model by analyzing the receiver operating characteristics (ROC), or ROC curves, which illustrates the performance of a classifier model. ROC exhibits the relationship between true positive rate (TPR) and the false positive rate (FPR), which provides tools to select possibly optimal models and to discard suboptimal ones.

Since the datasets contain the human input, the manual input data can be utilized to improve the identification result as a one of the features. The definition of number of human interaction depends on the action required to complete a specific classification task. For instance, if the classification task requires user to click on the photos, the number of user clicks will then determine the number of human interaction. The classification results of the completely automated feature extractor and semi-automated feature extractor should be compared to determine the optimal human involvement.
