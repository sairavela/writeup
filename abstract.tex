% In this thesis, I designed and implemented a compiler which performs
% optimizations that reduce the number of low-level floating point operations
% necessary for a specific task; this involves the optimization of chains of
% floating point operations as well as the implementation of a ``fixed'' point
% data type that allows some floating point operations to simulated with
% integer arithmetic.  The source language of the compiler is a subset of C,
% and the destination language is assembly languagesadsdasdsd for a
% micro-floating point CPU.  An instruction-level simulator of the CPU was
% written to allow testing of the code.  A series of test pieces of codes was
% compiled, both with and without optimization, to determine how effective
% these optimizations were.

The ability to identify individual animals is crucial for non-invasive
ecological monitoring and conservation planning. This project proposes two
improvements to the recognition process and ranked retrieval of Sloop, the first
image retrieval engine that couples automated pattern recognition with
crowd-sourced relevance feedback for individual animal identification.

With a crowd-sourced relevance feedback simulator, we report a number of
studies corroborating the accretion of precision and recall of the retrieval
results after various rounds of relevance feedback and the effects of error
propagation.

We then describe Sloop MTurk, the crowdsourced relevance feedback integration
module for Sloop.

In the later part, we propose a new architecture for animal pattern
recognition, which could possibly reduce the necessity for human
involvement in feature extraction by using transfer learning. Then, we experiment
with a variety of binary classifiers in order to identify the algorithm that
achieves good performance on our data. Our results reveal that Convolutional
network with linear support vector machine with radial basis kernel function
(SVM-RBF) achieves very robust performance on Otago and Grand data.
