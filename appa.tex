Suppose each HIT is distributed to $n$ workers, or in other words, each HIT
contains $n$ assignments and there are $m$ questions for each assignments.  For
each assignment, the chance that an assignment is accepted with an incorrect
answer to the unknown pair is $\frac{1}{2^m}$, and the chance that an assignment
is rejected is $\epsilon_m = (1-\frac{1}{2^{m-1}})$

The probability that only one assignment out of $n$ assignments is accepted with
an incorrect answer to the unknown pair is
$$\epsilon_m^{n-1} \cdot \frac{1}{2^m}$$
The probability that two assignments are accepted, but the resulting answer to
the unknown pair is incorrect is
$$\epsilon_m^{n-2} \cdot \binom{2}{2}\frac{1}{2^{2\cdot m}}$$
if both are incorrect, and
$$\epsilon_m^{n-2} \cdot \binom{2}{1}\frac{1}{2^{2\cdot m}}$$
if both answers are `do not match' and the actual answer is the same.
The error rate in this case is thus
$$3 \cdot \epsilon_m^{n-2} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{2\cdot m}}$$
if both answers are `do not match' and the actual answer is the same.
The probability that three assignments are accepted, but the resulting answer to
the unknown pair is incorrect is
$$\epsilon_m^{n-3} \cdot \binom{3}{3}\frac{1}{2^{3\cdot m}}$$
if all are incorrect, and
$$\epsilon_m^{n-3} \cdot \binom{3}{2}\frac{1}{2^{3\cdot m}}$$
if two are incorrect.
The error rate in this case is thus
$$4 \epsilon_m^{n-3} \cdot \frac{1}{2^{3\cdot m}}$$
if two are incorrect.
Let $i$ be the number of assignments accepted and
$\epsilon_{nm} = \frac{1}{2^m\epsilon_m}$.
The error rate can be generalized as follows:
\begin{description}
  \item[$i$ is odd:]
  $$(\binom{i}{i} + \binom{i}{i-1} + \cdots +
  \binom{i}{\frac{i+1}{2}})\epsilon_{nm}^i \epsilon_m^n$$
  \item[$n$ is even:]
  $$(\binom{i}{i} + \binom{i}{i-1} + \cdots +
  \binom{i}{\frac{i}{2}})\epsilon_{nm}^i \epsilon_m^n$$
\end{description}
By the binomial theorem, the total error rate is bounded by
