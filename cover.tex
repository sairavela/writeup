% If you wish to list your previous degrees on the cover page, use the 
% previous degrees command:
%       \prevdegrees{A.A., Harvard University (1985)}
% You can use the \\ command to list multiple previous degrees
%       \prevdegrees{B.S., University of California (1978) \\

% If the thesis is for two degrees simultaneously, list them both
% separated by \and like this:
% \degree{Doctor of Philosophy \and Master of Science}
\degree{Master of Engineering in Computer Science and Engineering}

% As of the 2007-08 academic year, valid degree months are September, 
% February, or June.  The default is June.

%% By default, the thesis will be copyrighted to MIT.  If you need to copyright
%% the thesis to yourself, just specify the `vi' documentclass option.  If for
%% some reason you want to exactly specify the copyright notice text, you can
%% use the \copyrightnoticetext command.

% If there is more than one supervisor, use the \supervisor command
% once for each.

% Make the titlepage based on the above information.  If you need
% something special and can't use the standard form, you can specify
% the exact text of the titlepage yourself.  Put it in a titlepage
% environment and leave blank lines where you want vertical space.
% The spaces will be adjusted to fill the entire page.  The dotted
% lines for the signatures are made with the \signature command.
\maketitle

% The abstractpage environment sets up everything on the page except
% the text itself.  The title and other header material are put at the
% top of the page, and the supervisors are listed at the bottom.  A
% new page is begun both before and after.  Of course, an abstract may
% be more than one page itself.  If you need more control over the
% format of the page, you can use the abstract environment, which puts
% the word "Abstract" at the beginning and single spaces its text.

%% You can either \input (*not* \include) your abstract file, or you can put
%% the text of the abstract directly between the \begin{abstractpage} and
%% \end{abstractpage} commands.

% First copy: start a new page, and save the page number.

\section*{Acknowledgments}

This thesis would not have been possible without the support and help from many
individuals to whom I am sincerely appreciated.

First, I would like to express my deepest gratitude to my advisor, Dr.\ Srinivas
Ravela, for his expert guidance, profound understanding, and encouragement
throughout my study and research. Without his counsel and great patience, this
work would truly not have been possible.

I would also like to extend my greatest appreciation to Randy Westlund for
providing indispensable advice, insights, and invaluable guidance in every
aspect of my research, not to mention how much his engineering passion and
enthusiasm have inspired me. His willingness to generously spend time
discussing and his unceasing help were indeed imperative to the completion of this
thesis.

Additionally, I would like to take this opportunity to thank my family for
their unequivocal support for which my mere expression of thanks likewise does
not suffice.

This research is funded by New Zealand Department of Conservation (DOC).
